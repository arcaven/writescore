## When to Create Tickets 🔴

### Epic

* Organizing related stories under a common theme

### Story

* Adding new functionality that delivers user value
* Making significant enhancements to existing features
* Work can be completed within a single sprint

### Bug
* Functionality doesn't work as expected
* System behavior contradicts requirements
* Performance is significantly below expectations
* Security vulnerabilities are identified

### Task
* Work is technical in nature with no direct user value
* Documentation needs to be created or updated
* Configuration changes are required
