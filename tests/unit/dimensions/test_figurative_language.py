Tests for FigurativeLanguageDimension - metaphor, simile, and idiom detection.

Covers:
- Simile detection (regex patterns)
- Metaphor detection (embedding-based semantic analysis)
- Idiom detection (lexicon lookup with context checking)
- AI cliché identification
- Technical literal filtering
- Scoring algorithm (frequency, variety, novelty, cliché ratio)
- Edge cases (empty text, short text, no figurative language)
- Performance benchmarks (AC: 5 - target < 15s for 10k words)
