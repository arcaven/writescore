# Story 5.1: Modernize README Following 2025 Best Practices

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** potential user or contributor visiting the WriteScore repository,
**I want** a clear, scannable, and professionally structured README,
**so that** I can quickly understand what the project does, determine if it solves my problem, and start using it within 30 seconds.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Content Structure (AC 1-5)

1. README begins with project title, enhanced badge suite, and 1-2 sentence value proposition that clearly states the problem WriteScore solves
2. Visual demo (GIF) showing CLI analysis in action appears within first screen viewport
3. Quick Start section enables copy-paste execution resulting in first analysis output within 30 seconds
4. README length is under 200 lines (excluding blank lines), with detailed content linked to docs/
5. Table of Contents links to major sections and external documentation

### Content Migration (AC 6-8)

6. "Package Structure" section moved to `docs/architecture.md` (create if needed)
7. "Development Roadmap", "Current Status", and phase history moved to `docs/DEVELOPMENT-HISTORY.md`
8. "Design Principles" moved to `docs/architecture.md`

### New Elements (AC 9-12)

9. Enhanced badge suite includes: CI status, coverage, version, license, Python version, and documentation status
10. "Why WriteScore?" section explains unique value proposition and differentiators
11. Feature highlights presented as benefits (what users gain), not just technical capabilities
12. Contributing section links to CONTRIBUTING.md (create minimal version if not exists)

### Quality & Accessibility (AC 13-16)

13. All images include descriptive alt text for screen readers
14. Code examples use syntax highlighting with appropriate language tags
15. Line lengths in code blocks do not exceed 90 characters for mobile readability
16. No orphaned links - all documentation links verified working

## Dev Notes

### Current README Analysis

The existing README at 483 lines contains valuable information but is structured for internal development tracking rather than user onboarding.

> **Note:** Line numbers below are approximate (verified 2025-01-26). Identify sections by heading text if line numbers have shifted.

**Content to Keep (in condensed form)**:
- Project title and badges (lines 1-6)
- Brief description (lines 8-10)
- Installation instructions (lines 68-95)
- CLI usage examples (lines 109-157)
- Analysis modes comparison table (lines 129-137)
- Accuracy expectations section (lines 161-198)

**Content to Migrate**:
- Package Structure (lines 26-64) → `docs/architecture.md`
- Version 6.0.0 migration notes (lines 12-24) → keep brief note, link to MIGRATION
- Development phases (lines 309-425) → `docs/DEVELOPMENT-HISTORY.md`
- Design Principles (lines 348-388) → `docs/architecture.md`
- Testing Strategy (lines 427-433) → `docs/architecture.md` or CONTRIBUTING.md

**Content to Remove**:
- Line counts next to files (internal metric)
- Detailed phase completion checkmarks
- "Next Steps for Developers" (internal)

### Current Badge URLs (Preserve These)

```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/jmagady/writescore/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jmagady/writescore/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Python 3.9+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-6.3.0-green.svg)](https://github.com/jmagady/writescore/releases)
```

**New badges to add (Task 6):**
- Coverage: `[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-XX%25-brightgreen.svg)]` (if codecov/coveralls configured)
- Docs: `[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-available-blue.svg)](docs/)`

### GIF Recording Options

**Recommended Tool:** [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) - scripted terminal recordings

```bash
# Install VHS
brew install vhs

# Create recording script (demo.tape)
# VHS produces consistent, repeatable recordings
```

**Alternative Tools:**
- **asciinema + svg-term**: Produces animated SVG (smaller than GIF)
- **terminalizer**: Node-based terminal recorder
- **Native screen recording**: QuickTime → gifski for conversion

**Demo Command:**
```bash
writescore analyze tests/fixtures/human/sample.md --mode adaptive
```

### Reference: 2025 Best Practices Key Points

From deep research (sources: GitHub docs, Archbee, Good Docs Project, Shields.io):

1. **30-second rule**: User should be able to run first command within 30 seconds of landing
2. **Value-first**: Lead with problem solved, not technical implementation
3. **Visual proof**: Demo GIF dramatically increases engagement
4. **Scannable**: Headers, tables, short paragraphs enable quick comprehension
5. **Link, don't embed**: Detailed docs should live separately
6. **Badge credibility**: Quality badges signal project health

### Testing

**Testing Standards**:
- No automated tests required (documentation only)
- Manual verification checklist:

| Check | Method |
|-------|--------|
| Links work | Click all links in rendered README |
| GIF loads | View on GitHub and mobile |
| Quick start works | Follow instructions from fresh clone |
| Mobile readable | View on phone or narrow viewport |
| Line count | `wc -l README.md` |
| Alt text present | View image HTML or inspect |

### Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered post-implementation:

1. **Before starting:** Create a checkpoint commit with current README state
   ```bash
   git add README.md && git commit -m "checkpoint: README before modernization"
   ```

2. **Rollback README only:**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~N -- README.md  # where N = commits since checkpoint
   ```

3. **Full rollback:** `git revert <commit-hash>` for the modernization commit

**Note:** Migrated content in docs/ can remain even if README is rolled back.
