# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals

- **Detect AI-generated writing patterns** across multiple linguistic dimensions with high accuracy
- **Provide actionable feedback** with specific line-by-line suggestions for improving writing authenticity
- **Score documents objectively** using a dual-score system that separates detection risk from writing quality
- **Support iterative improvement** by tracking score history across editing sessions
- **Scale to book-length documents** through intelligent sampling modes that balance speed vs. accuracy
- **Enable customization** via domain-specific terms, dimension profiles, and recalibrated parameters
- **Maintain scientific rigor** through percentile-anchored scoring derived from validated human/AI datasets

## 1.2 Background Context

As AI writing assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) have become ubiquitous, writers face a new challenge: their AI-assisted content often contains detectable patterns that undermine authenticity and trigger AI detection tools. These patterns include overuse of em-dashes, formulaic transitions ("Furthermore," "Moreover,"), uniform sentence lengths, and predictable vocabulary choices.

WriteScore addresses this by providing writers with detailed analysis of their text across 18 linguistic dimensions—far more comprehensive than simple AI detectors that only give a binary "AI/human" verdict. Rather than just flagging content as AI-generated, WriteScore shows *exactly which patterns* trigger detection and *how to fix them*, enabling writers to maintain their authentic voice while leveraging AI assistance.

**Target Users:** Individual writers improving their own content—technical writers, fiction authors, content creators, and anyone wanting to reduce AI-detectable patterns in their writing.
